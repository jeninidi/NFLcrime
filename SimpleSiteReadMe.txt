Hello and thank you for your attention!

In this file you will find my thoughts and comments on the taken task!

First of all, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to apply for a workplace in your company!

Second,I'd like to give an overview of my work.

Overall, the task appeared to be challenging for me as I hadn't worked on an application connected
to an API where I had to completely build it from scratch.

As I had done it many times before, the creation of the repository and the project proved to be easy
and non-time confusing.

I believe the part that took most of my time was the coding of the services(new territory for me),
alongside with a few routing and Angular Material Module errors. That being said, I did not manage to 
properly assign the given time per exercise, which resulted in not full completion of the tasks.

However, I do have the implemented functionality of communication with the API and rendering the
crimes page, alongside with basic UI.

A better way in which I could implement the navigation is by using a SideBar or Navbar pinned to the top of each page. For that I could use the Angular Material nav-bar and side-bar tags. An Angular Material table was also my initial idea for styling the tables and the rendered information. For the filering task, I wold expand on the services and use pipes to render it in the front end. A logical solution for the datepicker would be to implement it in the main navigation page and to also connect it to the API

I would be more than happy to hear your thoughts and opinion on how I can improve my workflow and 
which abilities need further development in order for me to succeed in my career path. 

Thank you for your time and the opportunity!

With respect,
Zheni Dimitrova
